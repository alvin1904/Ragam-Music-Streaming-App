RAGAM is a music streaming and curation app built using the MERN stack. It allows users to stream music, create playlists, add songs to them, and search for songs from a vast list of available tracks. Additionally, RAGAM can generate a random playlist for users who want to discover new music. 

The app also features user profiles, where users can edit their details and view their listening history. With a clean and intuitive user interface, RAGAM offers a seamless experience for music lovers to enjoy their favorite tunes and explore new ones.

The client side of the app is built using REACT framework. The client is deployed on Netlify. The server side of the app is built using Node.js and Express.js. The database used is MongoDB (visit important links to go to server repo).
